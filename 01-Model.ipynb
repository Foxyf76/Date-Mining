Pt described period of difficulty that started 10/2001 with lack of work as an copyeditor and a break up w a BF that spiraled into her dc of medications and decompensation of mental state, requiring extensive inpatient and residential care.  She feels she has recovered from that mental health relapse and is healthier at this time, putting greater focus on her overall health and well being, having positive supports and being honest w them about her functioning, and feeling a strong connection w her psychiatrist.  While pt has made great strides in improving her mental health, supports, and activities, there is concern w her level of distress and attachment related to the current relationship and how problems within that relationship could be risk factors for her decline in functioning.
