The patient does not meet criteria for a major mood or anxiety disorder. She is not at imminent risk of harm to self or others. She would benefit from psychotherapy to help her integrate her experience of cancer and the break-up of her engagement, and to think through how to continue to create a life for herself moving forward.   \n",
